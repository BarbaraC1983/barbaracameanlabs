## Introduction
Creating a Jupyter notebook that is well commented and tells the story of your code / project is very important. 

It will be relevant for your upcoming projects during the bootcamp.

## Objective 
We are giving you a deliberately silly exercise to get comfortable with jupyter notebook, and how to submit work from jupyter to us via github and the student portal. 

## Getting Started
Open a new jupyter notebook file on your laptop. 

In the notebook that you created, you will introduce someone and her/his holidays preference with a picture and a link to a youtube video of this holiday preference 
(It can be you, a friend or family member :D) 

+ Give the notebook a heading title 
+ Explain the purpose of the notebook with a markdown cell
+ Write a function that takes an input - which will be the selected person's name
+ upload a photo of that person to the notebook 
+ Write a function that takes input for their holidays preference. This can be one question or multiple questions to understand this person's preferences. Make sure you test it yourself. 
+ Add a photo or screenshot of the holiday destination
+ Add bullet points of the top 3 things that the person likes to do  at this destination.
+ Try to make the text colorful, bold or italic.
+ Add a link to a youtube video of the destination.
+ add relevant annotations to explain any function or module you have used 

### Optional 
+ create an navigable index at the top of your jupyter notebook  
+ Add titles to all sections you have created, and then create hyperlinks from the elements of the index to their corresponding section title.
+ using Jupyter Notebook Slides, try to present your solution in the slides format. 
  + Hint. using jupyter nbconvert [Notebook_Name] --to slides --post serve         

## Deliverables
notebook (.ipynb file) with your responses named as Jupyterlab.ipynb


## Submission
+ create and clone your ironhack labs repo from github locally, if you have not already (hint: this is a good time to set up your labs in an organised way!)
+ Upon completion of the noteboook, save your deliverables to your github repo clone (local folder)
+ Then add, commit git (using an appropriate commit message) and push your local copy changes to the remote
+ check your remote repo using githubdesktop, gitkraken, or via the browser to confirm the steps 
+ submit your github url via your student portal to let us know you have completed the lab
