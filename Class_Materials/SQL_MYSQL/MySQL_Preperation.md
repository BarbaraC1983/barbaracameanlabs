### MySQL Preperation
By: Florian Titze

+ Everybody needs a working SQL server and a client (preferably MySQL Workbench - not SequelPro, because that's buggy) - as explained in the Prework section of your student portal

+ Everybody in that client software needs to have imported
    * the Sakila movie database and (Run a test query, e.g. select * from sakila.actor; and make sure it runs successfully and returns rows). 
      If you chose a full install of MySQL workbench, this database is already included. If not, use the sakila-schema.sql attached first, and run it in MySQL workbench. 
      After that, run the sakila-data.sql )
    * the czech bank database (Run a test query, e.g. select * from bank.account; and make sure it runs successfully and returns rows). 
    Use the mysql_dump.sql file you find on #data-general on Slack to import 
    (in MySQL workbench via Sever -> Data Import -> Import from Dump Project Folder.... select the folder in which the dump file is in, -> Start Import)
 + After every import of databases, you need to press the tiny refresh button in the SCHEMAS field.



Note: to check if the mysql works properly from the command line, you can run the following command 
mysql -u root -p 
which  will ask you to enter the password of your database user (in this example, it is the "root" user)
