# Data Analytics Project Presentation Guidelines
Here I list  some important guidelines of your presentation that you can use as a checklist for your preparation.

ðŸ‘‰ **Characteristics of a good presentation**



* great presentation/documentation = content + design + delivery.
* summarised information: No need to put every detail that you worked on (we know that you are working hard).
* simple and clear: not too much text, no complex charts.
* show only the charts that makes sense:  if a pattern is not clear in a specific chart or you are unsure about the interpretation, then please don't add it
* Every chart/plot has legend, title, differentiating colors and is easy to interpret.
* The presentation is there to support you in telling your data story and not to limit you.
* A presentation that creates a contradiction.

ðŸ‘‰ **The proposed structure (checklist)**

1. state the question / business problem:  simply and clearly, one-sentence take away

2. state the user persona and the dream solution for her/him: who is going to benefit from your insights (Marketing Manager? Doctor? Investor? normal user (music listener?),What does she/he expect?

3. the type of the question / business problem ( descriptive, predictive, BI Dashboard, Hypothesis testing)

4. Data set overview: (Data that you have in hand)

   4.1. The origin of the Data set / type of gathering (web scraping/ API, etc)

   4.2. high level descriptive summary  of the data set  ( number of rows, columns, quality of data, format of the data( multiple text files, JSON files, Image files, etc),percentage of missing values, etc

   4.3. up to three plots to highlight the key summary about the data and to give feeling about the distribution of the Data

5. Insights/ Findings: (your results)

   5.1. Describe the features used for the modelling ( highlight the feature selection technique if exists)

   5.2. The methods/algorithms used for modelling, mention how many iterations you went through

   5.3. share up to three interesting Insights / Findings/ Patterns and interpret the results

   5.4. highlight one example of the most important feature and its correlation to the target variable or the group (in case of unsupervised learning)

   5.5. The model accuracy on the test data( and if possible new unseen data, live demo?)

6. Data processing pipeline (what you have done to come up with the results above)

   6.1. Highlights 2 interesting examples/patterns of your Data cleaning work with plots ( Missing values, outliers, Data formatting)

   6.2. Highlights 2 interesting examples/patterns of your Data Transformation process

7. Limitations / outlook

   7.1. current limitations/ blocking points with the project

   7.2. things to do in the future when you have additional time
