# Lab Tableau Dashboard

Using Super store Data set [Data](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_OCT_2021/blob/main/Class_Materials/Data_Visualization/Tableau/Data/Sample%20-%20Superstore.xls), you are required to build a Dashboard using Tableau that gives better insight for the business executives about the overall performance of the business.

- The dashboard/s has four filters:  Region, Segment, Category, sub Category
- YTD(latest year) KPIs: 
   - total profit
   - total sales
   - total discount
   - (optional):  show the YoY growth rate ( comparing the current measure with the prior year)
- show the quarterly sales over years
- show the quarterly profit over years
- optional: profit margin(%) drilled down by sub-category
- top 5 most profitable "corporate" customers.
- top 3 most profitable product sub categories in every region.
- (optional): show the return rate(orders returned) by sub-category by region
- (optional): any chart/s that you may think that can show very important insight/pattern about the business performance. 

The dashboard should have clean and well readable design. All charts have titles, labels etc. the dashboard should be tested on a desktop layout. You may decide to split the dashboard into two dashabords ( Executive, Operational(orders, customers, etc) if it is needed.
