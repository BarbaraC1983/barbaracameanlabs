# Activity Spotipy

In order to use the `Spotify` API (`SpotiPy`), create an account in `Spotify` and follow [these](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/) steps. Once you have done it, work on the following instructions:

- Create a list and assign it to a variable named `my_20_artists`.
- Loop over your 20 favorite artists and their results to the list.
- Create a function that takes a list of artist names and return their 50 first appearances as a dictionary.
