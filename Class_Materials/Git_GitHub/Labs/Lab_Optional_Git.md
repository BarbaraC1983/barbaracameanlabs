# Lab | Git

## Introduction

Being able to use both, git and GitHub, is an important skill every software/data engineer must possess. This is even more important when it comes to its ability to handle code in collaborative projects. This lab will help you learn how use it. This lab will help you learn how to use it and understand its importance better.

## Git Branching

Now let's practice the collaboration part with Branching!.

Pair yourself with a classmate. Send the link to your repository on GitHub to your pair via Slack. Now each of you should perform the following set of actions:

1. Fork the classmate's repository.
2. Clone it so you have it locally and you can make changes.
3. Create a new branch named `classmate`.
4. Create a new file with your name (ex. `maya.txt`) and finish the following sentence _I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because..._. When you are done, save the changes.
5. Add the changes to git.
6. Commit and push changes. Now, all the changes should be on your GitHub inside the forked repository.
7. Create a pull request to make changes appear in the original repository.
8. Merge the branch your classmate created and now everyone's repos should have the original file (`about.txt`) as well as the new one with your classmate's name.

We hope you enjoyed this activity and learned something new about your classmates! :heart:
