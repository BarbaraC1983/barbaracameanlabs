# Lab | Git

## Introduction

Being able to use both, git and GitHub, is an important skill every software/data engineer must possess. This is even more important when it comes to its ability to handle code in collaborative projects. This lab will help you learn how use it. This lab will help you learn how to use it and understand its importance better.

## Instructions

1. First of all, install git if you don't have it yet, and create a GitHub account. (_In case you haven't made it to the bonus section in the Prework, refer to the lesson "Install Git and Create GitHub Account", that you will find there. Follow the guidelines given there. Additionally, you can use these resources: [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Version control with git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)_)

2. Create a new repository in GitHub. Name it `Iron`+ your name. Example: if your name is _Alvaro_, you will name the repo `IronAlvaro`.
3. Clone that repo to your computer.
4. Create a file in that folder. Name it `about.txt` and add a fun fact about yourself. (_You can use the command line: `touch nameOfTheFile.txt`_).
5. Add the file you just created to git.
6. Commit the change.
7. Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.

Great! This was pretty smooth, we hope. :rocket:

Now let's practice the collaboration part.

### Pair Programming exercise

Pair yourself with a classmate. Send the link to your repository on GitHub to your pair. Choose which one of your repositories will be the central repository that you both will collaborate on. That means ONLY your repository (or your pair's repository) will be the central repository for both of you. 

Now each of you should perform the following set of actions: ( Here we assume that YOUR repository is the central repository that you both will collaborate on)
("You" meansyour task, "Your pair" means your pair's task).
1. (YOU) Give access to your pair (with read/write permissions) to be able to collaborate on your repository.
2. (Your Pair) Clone the central repository so you have it locally and you can make changes.
3. (BOTH) Create a new file with your name (ex. `maya.txt`) and finish the following sentence _I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because..._. When you are done, save the changes.
4. (BOTH) Update the file "about.txt". first delete its old contents and  each one of you will add small paragraph about his contribution to this project. When you are done, save the changes.
5. Add the changes to git. (Make sure that you solve any conflict manually if it appears).
6. Commit and push changes. Now, all the changes should be on the central repository.

We hope you enjoyed this activity and learned something new about your classmates! :heart:
